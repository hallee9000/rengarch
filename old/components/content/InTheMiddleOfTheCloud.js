    <h4>旧玻璃单元的再使用</h4>
    <p>云中间位于北京市顺义区前礼务村，每次走在前往村口的前怡路上，两边的田地总让人心旷神怡。</p>

    <p>2021年8月,在诗人范学宜的邀请与参与下，我们来到顺义前礼务村进行一处院落改造。院子主人的初衷即是通过这样一处地方开启一段新生活。设计前期沟通中,我们了解到业主从事建筑施工行业，常年施工中遗留有大量的成品废弃玻璃无法使用。基于此，我们想到如何通过设计重新使用这些废弃的玻璃，表达观念的同时节省施工造价。</p>

    <h4>云中想象</h4>
    <p>对天空的想象，有时在不经意中出现。对于它的丈量，天空以下或许是参照物。于空中环绕，在云中呼吸。如果用蓝色玻璃遮挡一些建筑，是否能获得多一点想象。</p>

    <p>设计过程中统计有1000平米可使用玻璃，其中2.8*1.4米玻璃有90块，1*1米玻璃大约有500块，除了外立面玻璃门窗所需要的玻璃部分，剩下部分我们希望用在院子的营造中。</p>

    <h4>设计的考虑有以下几点：</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>院子的总平面呈L形布局，建筑分别布置于北向和西向并处于不同高差，我们希望通过一个“界面”将两处建筑视觉上连接在一起。</li>
      <li>建筑功能包含办公、会客与住宿。因考虑到功能所需要的不同私密程度的特征，我们希望在院落与建筑之间增加一个界面过渡，弱化室内与室外的视觉干扰，增加作为房屋前院的意向。</li>
      <li>“界面”可作为植物架，供植物攀爬，遮荫避凉，成为随四季“呼吸”变化的立面。</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>玻璃单元框架</h4>
    <p>为此，我们设计了一条L形布局的玻璃单元框架作为建筑前方的界面。关于玻璃框架结构的平面定位，主要基于建筑内部的结构柱网中心线，我们将其延深至院落中，形成了接近3*3m的平面网格，确立了平面尺寸。考虑到西边建筑的屋檐高3.5米，我们将玻璃框架高度设置为3.5米。</p>

    <h4>可适应的框架</h4>
    <p>因旧玻璃尺寸是已知的，所以在设计框架尺寸的时候需充分考虑已有玻璃的多种尺寸、玻璃自身尺寸的变化以及施工过程中的安装偏差，并让框架适应旧玻璃尺寸。为此我们对于框架间的尺寸进行了一定的放大与预留，同时采用基于框架结构的外侧安装。</p>

    <h4>架高平台</h4>
    <p>院外南向的自然风景优美，由于现状院墙较高，于是抬高视线的想法出现。在玻璃框架西北端我们设计了一处高2.6米的平台，可以随着玻璃踏步拾级而上，登高望远。</p>

    <h4>影壁</h4>
    <p>院子一进门所面对的是类似于影壁意向的一段玻璃框架。设计中，我们与业主充分沟通，而影壁是基于心理层面的考虑。基于几个因素而形成整体下的分段设计，给整个玻璃框架带来变化。</p>

    <h4>村口</h4>
    <p>村口有一处值班室，于广袤的田间之中。这处值班室本身就具有了一些“文学性”。项目院子的西南角正好与值班室隔了一个十字路口。在围栏设计中，我们更多的考虑到怎么处理和值班室的关系，延续村口已具有的某种文学叙事。值班室表皮采用的是镀锌瓦楞钢板，同样我们也选择镀锌钢板通过类似编织的方法做出围栏，与之呼应。</p>

    <h4>其他思考</h4>
    <p>关于会客厅，我们在设计上做了一个0.48米的地面抬高，逐步抬高的阶梯提供了家具置入的台面，高差对家具的环绕使空间整体，也划分了不同功能属性的空间，提供了更多使用上的可能性。</p>


    <h3>In the middle of the cloud /RENGARCH + Fan Xueyi</h3>
    <p>Renovation of the courtyard using recycled waste glass</p>

    <p>The project is located in Qianliwu Village, Shunyi District, Beijing. The entrance to the village is surrounded by fields, which is soothing and joyful to walk past.</p>

    <p>In August 2021, at the invitation and participation of the poet Fan Xueyi, we came to Shunyi Qianliwu Village to renovate a courtyard. The original intention of the client is to start a new life in such a place. In our initial discussions, we learned that the client is engaged in the construction industry, and thus had access to a large amount of waste glass. Based on this information, we thought to design the yard in a way that utilises the waste glass and saves cost.</p>

    <h4>Yearning in the cloud</h4>
    <p>The yearning for the sky sometimes appears inadvertently. For its measurement of the sky, the sky below may be a reference. Surrounded by the sky, breathing in the clouds. If the blue glass can cover some buildings, whether it can get a little more imagination.</p>

    <p>We learned during the design process, that there are 1000 square meters of waste glass that can be used for this design, including 90 pieces of 2.8*1.4m glass and approximately 500 pieces of 1*1m glass. Except for the glass doors and windows of the facade, we hope to use the rest of the glasses in the construction of the yard.</p>

    <h4>The design considerations are as follows: </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>The overall plan of the yard is in an L-shaped layout. The buildings are arranged in the north and west directions and are at different heights. We hope to connect the two buildings visually through an "interface". </li>
      <li>The building includes office, reception and accommodation. Considering the need for different degrees of privacy, we hope to add an interface transition between the courtyard and the building to weaken the direct visual interference between indoor and outdoor. This will increase the intention to serve as the front yard of the house.</li>
      <li>The glass structure - "interface" in front of the building is designed to provide a medium for vines to climb, providing shade and becoming a breathing structure that changes with the seasons.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Glass unit frame</h4>
    <p>We designed an L-shaped layout of a glass unit frame as the front interface of the building. Regarding the structural positioning of the glass frame, we mainly considered the centerlines of the column grid structure inside the building, and we extend them into the courtyard, forming a plane grid close to 3*3m. Considering that the eaves of the west building are 3.5 meters high, we also set the glass frame height to 3.5 meters.</p>

    <h4>Adaptable frame</h4>
    <p>We designed the glass frame in consideration of the variety in size of the waste glass. We looked at how the glass can change in size due to external factors, as well as installation deviations during the construction process. For this reason, we enlarged the frame size and attached the glass externally to accommodate glass size changes.</p>

    <h4>Elevated platform</h4>
    <p>The south of the courtyard is surrounded by beautiful natural scenery, to take advantage of this, we designed the "interface" to rise above the courtyard wall with a 2.6 meters elevated platform. By doing so, it allows the visitors to look far away and enjoy the countryside view.</p>

    <h4>Screen wall</h4>
    <p>As soon as you enter the courtyard, you are faced with a section of glass frame to serve as a screen wall. This is commonly used to shield an entrance gate in traditional Chinese architecture. After communicating extensively with the client, we implemented the design based on Chinese geomancy. We used a segmented design in which the screen wall is connected to the overall "interface", creating variations in the design form.</p>

    <h4>Village entrance</h4>
    <p>At the entrance of the village, surrounded by vast fields, there is a duty room. The placement and imagery of this duty room have a sense of literariness. As the southwest corner of our courtyard is opposite the duty room we considered it when we envisaged our designs. We thought about how we can continue the literary narrative of the village entrance that it already has. We studied the design of the duty room and found that the facade of the duty room is made of galvanized corrugated steel plate. We decided to echo this in our fence design by using the same type of material and constructing it with methods similar to weaving.</p>

    <h4>Other thoughts</h4>
    <p>As for the reception room, we designed a 0.48-meter ground elevation to surround the furniture, creating a more coherent environment. This has the added benefits of proving separation of space, allowing them to fulfil their individual functions. In addition, elevating steps are in place as part of the ground elevation to provide possibilities for future usage.</p>
