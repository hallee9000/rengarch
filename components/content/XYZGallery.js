    <p>XYZ画廊位于北京798艺术区中二街。自2006年，诗人范学宜将自己的家居画廊搬到这里。在接下来的 17
      年里，举办了数百场艺术展览。2022年8月，在几位朋友的鼓励和帮助下，她希望将画廊改造成一个旨在通过艺术将人们聚集并传递希望的空间。</p>
    <p>
      798艺术区原身是于1952年筹建的重点工业项目，位于北京市朝阳区酒仙桥路2号。从2002年开始逐渐形成了一个艺术群落。随着时间推移，XYZ画廊见证了798艺术区的变化。这次改造像是处于回望以及面向未来的一次转折。</p>
    <h4>诗人的画廊之家</h4>
    <p>
      “阳光射进来，灰尘有了方向”，这是诗人范学宜老师对她的画廊的描述。从文学出发，并给参观者带来一个停靠点。基于诗人对于北方站台的记忆以及对于诗歌与原野的热爱，在展开设计工作中，站台、诗歌花园、转角街道等意向逐步出现。</p>
    <p>于此同时，诗人将画廊看成为家。在内容的思考上，新增的一个人的影院、书房以及翻新后的工作室构成了家的重要组成。</p>
    <h4>站台</h4>
    <p>站台作为停靠点的意向，连接出走与到达，具有某种未知，并带来慰藉与公共关怀。
      在入口的设计中，我们分了三个界面：原有798建筑的界面、当下翻新的设计界面以及来自原野和诗歌的“物”本身的界面。</p>
    <p>原有建筑外墙是红砖，但是在之后的经营中被粉刷掩盖，我们首先将原有红砖肌理打磨外露出来。</p>
    <p>
      建筑语言中，设计通过三个连续的拱形钢板顶棚，营造一个有韵律的檐下入口空间。钢板悬挑1.8米，跨度为2.5米（中间）与2.1米（两侧）,拱高1.1米，并通过工字钢作为每个拱圈之间的结构连接，其中工字钢的坡度也满足了雨水排水的需求。
    </p>
    <p>
      诗人对于东北老家有一个木格栅门窗的印象，这个记忆能让她从北京连接到她的老家黑龙江，在入口门厅，我们做了白色木格栅门与窗的组合立面。其中，格栅窗所在位置与下方的弧线钢板是一个隐藏的门，作为另一个可开启的门，满足了公共空间双开门的通道需求，同时视觉上形成了单开门的假象。
    </p>
    <h4>诗歌花园</h4>
    <p>
      让出更多的公共空间给到来往的人群，是画廊主以及我们的初衷。在过去17年的经营中，画廊入口就一直有一排自家种的花池。“花园”作为一个记忆被保留及延续下来。在形式上我们选择高低错落的状态，其中包含0.3米、0.5米和0.8米等不同的台阶标高，满足花池及座椅本身的功能需求后，又增加了互动性。红砖诗歌花园平台以0.6米宽、0.6
      -1.5米长和0.3-0.5米高的凹弧形红砖座位单元为组合，通过台阶连接在一起。凹弧形座位单元和入口处钢板拱顶形成上下镜像关系，在这里展示一种平衡。</p>
    <p>
      带有诗文与图画的青花陶瓷砖是诗人创作并在景德镇烧制的。设计中，我们将陶瓷砖砌筑在入口平台以及诗歌花园中。在这里，花池、植物、青花陶瓷砖、红砖及灰砖融合在一起。</p>
    <h4>展厅空间</h4>
    <p>
      室内共有220㎡，其中包含两个展厅，分别为90㎡和50㎡。我们将展厅顶部原有结构梁的混凝土肌理外露并进行了一定的处理，视觉上使原本3.8米高的空间增加挺拔和力量感，同时也是对一个时间段的记忆留存。</p>
    <h4>转角街道</h4>
    <p>
      从“站台”到“街道”，随着参观者到达连接展厅之间的走廊，有类似室外转角街道的意向。四个出入口集中在宽2.1米，长6米的走廊中，在出入及转向的过程中往往出现偶然和复杂性。设计中，我们在入口处的顶部处理中延用拱券的形式作为室外顶棚拱券语言的延续，以此加强室内外意向的连接。通过走廊，展开四个空间：展厅、一个人的书房和一个人的影院。
    </p>
    <h4>一个人的影院与收藏装置</h4>
    <p>
      走廊中，红紫色帘子围合的空间以及光束构造了影院的氛围。在这里，放映诗人的动画作品《四季》以及展览的影像作品。在此，影院空间里的暗容易逼近观者的内心。</p>
    <p>收藏装置藏在影院空间的后面，通过帘子的收拉起到空间的合并与分隔，以此提供更加灵活的使用方式。</p>
    <p>收藏作品的储藏装置使用50mm*50mm方钢搭建，通过上下方的钢梁限位以及滚轮提供了方便的推拉，起到收纳与展示的使用转换。

    <p>XYZ Gallery is located at Middle Second Street in the 798 Art
      District in Beijing. In 2006, the poet artist Fan Xueyi moved her home gallery to 798. Over the next 16 years, XYZ
      Gallery has been the venue of hundreds of art exhibitions. In August 2022, with the encouragement and help of
      several friends, she set out to transform XYZ Gallery into a space meant to bring people together and give them
      hope through art.</p>
    <p>The 798 Art District originally was an industrial zone
      established in 1952 located at No. 2 Jiuxianqiao Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing,. Since 2002, it gradually
      developed into an art community. Over the years, XYZ Gallery has witnessed the changes of the 798 Art District.
      The redesign now is like a pivot point between the past and the future.</p>
    <h4>A Poet’s Gallery Home</h4>
    <p>&quot;Sunlight falls in, dust finds a purpose.&quot; This is
      how the poet artist Fan Xueyi describes her gallery. The space invites visitors with poetry to stop in. Inspired
      by the poet&#x27;s memory of a train stop in the North of China and her love for poetry and nature, the ideas of a
      station, a poetry garden, a street-like corridor and other elements were gradually incorporated in the design.</p>
    <p>At the same time, Fan Xueyi regards the gallery as a home. The
      newly added video and book rooms, together with the refurbished studio, are important elements to make visitors
      feel at home in the redesigned gallery.</p>
    <h4>Station</h4>
    <p>A station serves as a point of departures and arrivals; there
      is a certain element of the unknown, yet it brings convenience and comfort. In the design of the entrance, we took
      into account three interfaces: the original 798 building, the new design, and the experience linked to poetry and
      nature.</p>
    <p>The exterior wall of the original building is made of red
      brick, but it was subsequently painted in shiny red. To begin, we removed that paint to expose the original red
      brick texture.</p>
    <p>In architectural language, the new design creates a rhythmic
      entrance space under eaves formed by three consecutive steel arches. The cantilevered steel roof reaches 1.8
      meters out from the wall, with arches that span 2.5 meters (middle arch) and 2.1 meters (each side arch) and have
      a height of 1.1 meters. An I-beam serves as the structural connection between each arch, its slope also meets the
      need for rainwater drainage.</p>
    <p>For the poet artist, wooden grille doors and windows remind of
      her home in Northeast China and connect Beijing with her hometown in Heilongjiang. For the entrance, we combined a
      white wooden grille door with a white grille window. Below the window is a curved steel plate, which together
      serve as a second door. Thus, the structure meets the passage requirement of a double door for a public space, but
      at the same time create the illusion of a single door.</p>
    <h4>Poetry Garden</h4>
    <p>The gallery owner wanted to give more space to by-passers. In
      the past, there was a rectangular concrete-made box containing a bed of home-grown flower alongside the front of
      the gallery. The memory of this garden is preserved. In terms of form, we choose a staggered set of blocks with
      different elevations at 0.3 meter, 0.5 meter and 0.8 meter. Besides meeting the functional need of flower beds and
      serving as seats, this lay-out increases interactivity. The red brick poetry garden combines concave red brick
      seat units that are 0.6 meter wide, between 0.6 to 1.5 meters long and between 0.3 to 0.5 meter high and are
      connected by steps. The concave curved seat unit and the steel plate arches at the entrance form an up-and-down
      mirror relationship for a balanced overall appearance.</p>
    <p>The blue and white ceramic tiles with poems and pictures
      written and drawn by the poet artist were made in Jingdezhen. The design incorporates ceramic bricks and tiles
      both in the entrance floor and the poetry garden. The flower beds and plants now are integrated with the blue and
      white ceramic tiles and the red and gray bricks.</p>
    <h4>Exhibition Space</h4>
    <p>The gallery has a total area of 220 square meters, consisting
      of two exhibition halls of 90 square meters and 50 square meters respectively, a connecting corridor and several
      other spaces. We exposed the concrete texture of the original structural concrete beams at the top of the
      exhibition halls, which were cleaned and polished to make the original 3.8-meters-tall space look even higher and
      give it a sense of strength while retaining the historic industrial look.</p>
    <h4>Street-like Corridor</h4>
    <p>Moving from the &quot;train stop&quot; to &quot;main
      street&quot;, the street-like corridor connecting the exhibition halls is meant to evoke a street corner. Four
      passage doors open to a corridor that is 2.1 meters wide and 6 meters long. This appears accidental and
      complicates the direction of visitor movement and flow. In the design, we use the form of portico-type arches as
      the continuation of the language of outdoor roof arches to strengthen the connection of indoor and outdoor
      elements. From the corridor, four spaces are accessible - the two main exhibition halls, a small bookroom and the
      video room.</p>
    <h4>Video Room and Storage</h4>
    <p>Off the corridor, a space surrounded by dark purple curtains
      and a beam of light create the atmosphere of a cinema. Here, the poet artist&#x27;s animated film
      &quot;Seasons&quot; and videos related to a particular gallery exhibition are shown. The darkness of the cinema
      space easily touches a viewer&#x27;s mood and feelings.</p>
    <p>The storage panels are hidden behind the cinema space. The
      curtain can be pulled to open up or separate the space, which allows its flexible usage.</p>
    <p>The storage for works from the gallery collection are built
      with 50mm*50mm square steel and diagonal mesh. The resulting panels have wheels and can be conveniently pushed and
      pulled along upper and lower steel beam guardrails. These panels can be used for display as well as storage.</p>
